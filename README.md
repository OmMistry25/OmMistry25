# I build simple things that matter.

I’m passionate about reimagining the everyday.  

My goal is to build smarter, more intuitive versions of the tools and utilities we use the most, but often overlook. I focus on simplifying complexity, automating what’s repetitive, and delivering experiences that just make sense.

Right now, I’m building **[mysmartlinq](https://mysmartlinq.com)**: a platform that powers context-aware smart links and QR codes. Our mission is to help businesses and creators deliver the right content to the right people at the right time.
